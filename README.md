Hi my names is Ramexo, I am currently learning how to code via CS50 free course.
Currently I am coding in C programming language. Its fun but difficult since C has weird synthax and no string data type.
I am not on the level to collaborate ony any projects yet, but one day I will get there.

PS. Once I am done with the course I will try to make some projects and try to post it here on github.
